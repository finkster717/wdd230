            <h3>Exhibit A</h3>
            <p>Visual Hierarchy:

                Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance. It guides the viewer's eye through a design, highlighting essential elements.<br><br>
                Hick's Law:<br>
                
                Hick's Law states that the time it takes for a person to make a decision is proportional to the number of choices available. In web design, it emphasizes the importance of simplicity and minimizing the number of options presented to users.<br><br>
                Fitt's Law:<br>
                
                Fitt's Law relates to the time it takes to move to a target area, such as a button, based on the size and distance of the target. It's often used to optimize the placement and size of interactive elements for better usability.<br><br>
                Rule of Thirds:<br>
                
                The Rule of Thirds involves dividing an image or design into a grid of nine equal parts, with important elements placed along the grid lines or at their intersections. It's a compositional guideline for creating balanced and visually appealing designs.<br><br>
                White Space and Clean Design:<br>
                
                White space, or negative space, is the area between design elements. It contributes to readability and a clean design by preventing visual clutter. Embracing white space is crucial for a minimalist and user-friendly interface.<br><br>
                PARC: Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, Contrast:<br>
                
                These principles, often referred to as the "PARC" principles, are fundamental in design:<br>
                Proximity: Group related elements together to create visual unity.<br>
                Alignment: Align elements to establish order and connection.<br>
                Repetition: Repeat design elements for consistency and recognition.<br>
                Contrast: Use contrast to highlight important elements and create visual interest.</p>
